## About me
Was always passioned about coding. Wrote my first line of code in Delphi in 1999 (yeah). Long story short I ended up in non-technical people facing role first as a sales manager and further along the way as an entrepreneur.

Have a failed startup and more or less working b2b business. But I always wondered if I could make it in a technical role. My coding experience is mostly tinkering the hardware in low-code platform Node-red using js.

    cards = [firstCard,secondCard]
